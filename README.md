# Discord Image API

## Currently the api works but theres an issue - It doesnt show the right color dot for status

### MUST BE IN [DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.com/invite/p9GuT5hakm) FOR THIS TO WORK
The [why discord server](https://discord.gg/Jm8QPF6xbN) will work too

**[DOCS](https://discordimage.herokuapp.com/docs)**

## Usage:

**URL:** https://discordimage.herokuapp.com/api/image?user_id=`[Your discord id]`

---

## Example:

### URL:
https://discordimage.herokuapp.com/api/image?user_id=624076054969188363


### Result:
[![Example Image](https://discordimage.herokuapp.com/api/image/?user_id=624076054969188363)](https://discordimage.herokuapp.com/docs)

Other Parameters: 

`&rounded_corners=False` to the end of the url for them to not be rounded

- If this is not included in url it defaults to true

`&resize_width=[custom_width]` resizes to that width (example the mini one at the top of the readme)

- This does reduce image quality though
- Also max width = 4269
